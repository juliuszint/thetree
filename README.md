## Simulation of a tree throughout the year.

This project was part of the computer graphics class from the first master
semester at the University of Applied Sciences in Hanover. It was designed to
be a group project of 4 people but ended up being done just by me.

Technically, it is a .NET 5 application and uses OpenTK (C# low level bindings
for OpenGL) to create the window and the simulation. ImageSharp from SixLabours
is used to load and decode the image assets from the disk.
